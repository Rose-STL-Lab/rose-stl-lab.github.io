### Storage Status

::: info Storage Update
The lab's shared storage had previously been at high utilization. We've freed up approximately 20TB of space and new drives are on the way to expand capacity. Please continue to be mindful of storage usage.
:::

| Storage Pool | Total | Used | Available | Usage |
|--------------|-------|------|-----------|-------|
| Shared HDD Cluster | ~140TB | Varies | ~20TB+ | Manageable |
| Per-user `/data` | 5TB | Varies | Varies | Check with `df -h /data` |
| Per-user `/public` | 5TB (shared) | Varies | Varies | Check with `df -h /public` |

**Best practices for storage management**:
1. Store large datasets on `/data` (synchronized across servers)
2. Keep environments and code on local SSD
3. Archive or compress old datasets
4. Clean up intermediate experiment results regularly
5. Use `/utilities/common-utilities.py` to clean pip cache if needed

### Current NVIDIA Driver Version

**Version**: 580.95.05

::: danger Important
Do **NOT** install nvidia-driver through your package manager (apt, yum, etc.). This will break GPU passthrough in containers.

If you accidentally corrupt your NVIDIA driver, use `/utilities/nvidia-upgrade.sh` and `sudo reboot` to fix it.

## Recent System Updates

### October 2025
- **Server Migration Complete**: All five roselab servers migrated to new network architecture
  - Server room move completed (wave 4, Oct 2)
  - Improved data loading speed between servers
  - Network upgraded to 100Gbps
  - roselab5 now has all 8x H200 GPUs online
- **roselab2 & roselab3 Back Online**: All NVIDIA drivers upgraded to version **580.95.05**
- **rosedata Recovered**: Storage server back online after data recovery
- **Storage Update**: Freed up ~20TB of space, new drives on the way

## Scheduled Maintenance

::: tip No Scheduled Maintenance
There is currently no scheduled maintenance. This page will be updated if maintenance is planned.
:::

<!--
### Example Future Maintenance Entry:
### November 15, 2025 - roselab3 Maintenance
- **Date**: November 15, 2025, 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM PST
- **Affected Server**: roselab3
- **Reason**: Hardware upgrade (additional RAM installation)
- **Impact**: roselab3 will be completely offline during this period
- **Action Required**:
  - Save all work and commit to Git before November 15
  - Consider migrating active containers to other servers using `/utilities/common-utilities.py`
  - All data in `/data` will remain accessible from other servers
-->

## Known Issues

::: tip No Active Issues
There are currently no major known issues. All servers and services are operational.

## Monitoring Your Resources

### Check Your Container Status

```bash
# Check CPU usage
htop

# Check GPU usage
nvidia-smi

# Check storage usage
df -h /
df -h /data

# Check network storage speed
dd if=/dev/zero of=/data/testfile bs=1M count=1024
# Should see ~300+ MB/s write speed
rm /data/testfile
```

### Grafana Dashboards

Visit [Grafana](http://roselab1.ucsd.edu/grafana/) to monitor:
- GPU utilization per container
- CPU and memory usage
- Network throughput
- Storage I/O

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues:
