### Storage Status

::: warning Storage Capacity Alert
Our 120TB HDD cluster is currently at **98% capacity**. We are actively researching and deleting outdated data. Please avoid saving new large datasets to `/data` until additional storage is provisioned.
:::

| Storage Pool | Total | Used | Available | Usage |
|--------------|-------|------|-----------|-------|
| 120TB HDD Cluster | 120TB | ~118TB | ~2TB | 98% |
| Per-user `/data` | 5TB | Varies | Varies | Check with `df -h /data` |
| Per-user `/public` | 5TB (shared) | Varies | Varies | Check with `df -h /public` |

**Recommendations during storage crunch**:
1. Avoid saving new large datasets to `/data`
2. Archive or compress old datasets
3. Move cold data to local servers or external storage temporarily
4. Clean up intermediate experiment results
5. Contact admin for data cleanup assistance

### Current NVIDIA Driver Version

**Version**: 580.95.05

::: danger Important
Do **NOT** install nvidia-driver through your package manager (apt, yum, etc.). This will break GPU passthrough in containers.

If you accidentally corrupt your NVIDIA driver, use `/utilities/nvidia-upgrade.sh` and `sudo reboot` to fix it.

## Known Issues

### Storage Space Limitations

**Issue**: 120TB cluster approaching capacity
**Status**: ðŸ”´ Active Issue
**Impact**: Users may not be able to save new large datasets
**Workaround**:
- Use local SSD for active work when possible
- Archive old data
- Contact admin for cleanup assistance
**ETA**: Pending hardware procurement approval

### rosedata Server Down

**Issue**: rosedata storage server offline for data recovery
**Status**: ðŸ”´ Active Issue
**Impact**: S3/MinIO services may be limited
**Workaround**: Use `/data` for storage
**ETA**: To be determined

<!--
### Example Resolved Issue:
### ~~Driver Version Mismatch~~ (Resolved)

**Issue**: Some containers showed "Driver/library version mismatch" error
**Status**: âœ… Resolved (October 4, 2025)

## Monitoring Your Resources

### Check Your Container Status

```bash
# Check CPU usage
htop

# Check GPU usage
nvidia-smi

# Check storage usage
df -h /
df -h /data

# Check network storage speed
dd if=/dev/zero of=/data/testfile bs=1M count=1024
# Should see ~300+ MB/s write speed
rm /data/testfile
```

### Grafana Dashboards

Visit [Grafana](http://roselab1.ucsd.edu/grafana/) to monitor:
